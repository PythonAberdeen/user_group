# Beginner challenge September 2020
The chellenge this month is to create a birthday look-up service. 

## Famous birthdays
1. You need to store at least six people's names and their birthdays. 

You can use the folowing or choose others:

- Stephen King - 21 September 1947
- Roger Federer - 8 May 1981
- Lewis Hamilton - 7 May 1985
- Lewis Capaldi - 7 October 1996
- Dame Judy Dench - 9 December 1934
- Baroness Susan Greenfield - 1 October 1950

2. Your system should print out to the screen a message as follows:
>> Welcome to the birthday look-up service.
>> We know the birthdates of
>> * Lewis Capaldi
>> * Dame Judy Dench
>> 
>> ... (complete the list)

>>Which person's birthday would you like to know?

3. Take user input of a name

4. Look it up in the data you store. If it matches return
>> NAME was born on DATE

5. If there was no match, ask the user to try again or to enter "Stop" to finish the service

6. If you had a successful match ask if they'd like another until they ask it to stop (edited) 

## Hints
You might want to look at using a [dictionary](https://www.educba.com/dictionary-in-python/) which holds key-value pairs for your data.
