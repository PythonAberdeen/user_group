## Beginner Challenge

### Problem

Your challenge is to take a file specifying a rectangular array of numbers such as the following:

     5    -7    -2    -1
    -5     8     2     0
    -8    -3     5    -3

This file is available as [rect1.txt](rect1.txt)

and find a sub-rectangle within which adds up to the largest possible sum.

For example, in the above, the largest sum sub-rectangle is

     8     2
    -3     5

with a sum of 12

whereas

     8     2     0
    -3     5    -3

would only have a sum of 9.

Write a program to print out the largest sum sub-rectangle, and it's total value. So the output would be

    total = 12
    
     8     2     0
    -3     5    -3

### Extra Test Cases

Another test case is [rect2.txt](rect2.txt) with a largest sum sub-rectangle adding to 208.

Finally, [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PythonAberdeen/user_group/master/2020-11/beginner/rect3.txt](rect3.txt) with a largest sum sub-rectangle adding 1650.
