    "\n",
    "Time series manipulation is perhaps one of the most dreaded and brain-braking data munging activities. We need good tools to facilitate our jobs. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this challenge you will try to perform some basic data analysis and manipulations that require working with time series. Python, especially through Pandas, has great time series funcionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of having a filled notebook where you (and me) can look at the answers I will first let you try to complete the challenge on your own. After you give it a go I will guide you through showing you my thought process and how I would solve some of the issues. This challenge will also be a test of how good you are at reading documentation. "
