# December beginner task #

Plot some maths functions. 


Examples:
 * ![y=x^2](http://www.sciweavers.org/tex2img.php?eq=y%3Dx%5E2&bc=White&fc=Black&im=png&fs=18&ff=arev&edit=0) between -2 and 2
 * ![y=sin(x)](http://www.sciweavers.org/tex2img.php?eq=y%3Dsin%28x%29&bc=White&fc=Black&im=png&fs=18&ff=arev&edit=0) between -2π and 2π
 * ![y=e^(-x/8)*cos(x)](http://www.sciweavers.org/tex2img.php?eq=y%3De%5E%7B%5Cfrac%7B-x%7D%7B8%7D%7D%20cos%28x%29&bc=White&fc=Black&im=png&fs=18&ff=arev&edit=0) between 0 and 10
 
 Inlining of images for above seems a bit temperamental - if it's not working, or they're all giving the same expression can maybe get the right image by following the link. 
 
 Or just text versions of the maths:
  * `y = x**2`
  * `y = sin(x)`
  * `y = e ** (x/-8) * cos(x)`

## Pick an approach

Pick an approach to running code and plotting.

Options include:
 * [matplotlib/pyplot](https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/introductory/pyplot.html)
 * [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) Could use hosted Jupyter notebook to do this exercise without needing anything installed locally. 
 * [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/)
 
## Write maths function

Write a function to give y value of your maths expression from x value argument. 

## Calculate some data

Create a range of x values. 

Calculate the y values for each.

## Plot your data

Draw a graph with your data. 

## Next steps

Look at the options for controlling the style of your graph. 

Plot other functions.
